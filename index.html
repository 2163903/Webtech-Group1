			<p>Animal welfare is the well-being of animals. The standards of "good" animal welfare vary considerably between different contexts. These standards are under constant review and are debated, created and revised by animal welfare groups, legislators and academics worldwide. Animal welfare science uses various measures, such as longevity, disease, immunosuppression, behavior, physiology, and reproduction, although there is debate about which of these indicators provide the best information.</p>

					<h2>Clean and green makes perfect scene</h2>
					<p>Cleanliness is not a work that we do forcefully that is why barangay Scout Barrio is very conservative about cleanliness. They are very strict on following the schedule of disposing of garbages. The garbage must be properly segregated and must be prepared to be picked up by the truck. The schedule of the garbage collection is every wednesday 6:00 am. If the garbage is not prepared before 6:00 am, you will wait another week to be collected. Every Saturday, the whole community is working together to clean their barangay or also called as "bayanihan". They have also a program called "Anti-mosquito misting program".They are visiting all houses to mist their surroundings to prevent mosquito breeding. They are also reminding the community to clean their surroundings that may cause mosquito breeding. They are also imposing "Tapat mo, Linis mo". They are also giving penalties to those who are breaking the rules. As we walk in the barangay, we can barely see litters in the surroundings in this barangay.We also see trash bins in some parts in the barangay. The people here in this barangay are all responsible in means of cleanliness.</p>

					<h2>Saving the nature can save your life too! </h2>
					<p>What will be our situation if the nature is slowly destroyed?. Maybe the humanity will be endangered. That is why Barangay Scout Barrio is very protective in means of nature especially about trees. They got their eyes on the trees in the barangay especially their place is full of trees. They are very strict about illegal logging. You must have a city permit if you want to cut trees in their place. They have also a tree planting program done by the community in parts of their place to make their place cleaner and colorful. Everytime we passed this barangay, we are very comfortable about coolness of the place and the fresh air.</p>
