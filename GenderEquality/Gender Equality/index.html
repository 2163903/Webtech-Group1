					<h2>Family: Root of Equality!</h2>
					<p>In our country, you could see how diverse people are, and we asked them "What are the things should happen to promote gender equality?". We were shocked by the answer of our kagawad Mr. Teddy De San Andres. He said that it should begin with the family. There are some instances in a family, where when you are different from others (means that you are either gay or lesbian), some parents tend to scold their child, some are disappointed, some are very angry and sometimes they would also abuse and hurt their child physically just because they are different. If it started at home, how much more if he/she would go outside. They believed that the parents should treat their children equally, for what they are and what they want their children to be, they are still their children. Once their children would experience this kind of situations, the scar would remain, from the wound his/her parents gave him/her. But if his/her parents would raise their children good, accept them, give them all the love, and understand them, the barangay officials believed that if this happens in every household then, there would be more progress in gender equality in the community.</p>
					<p> It's not the child's fault if he/she feels that way, love your children in any circumstances. Parents, let's help bind the world together.

					<h2>An Open Barangay</h2>
					<p>In electing the members of the barangay officials, they don't really consider their gender. Scout Barrio, currently, has two female kagawads. They have been working well in the barangay and could easily cooperate with other officials. They believe that working with women would help the comitee more because they could get the perspective of women in planning activities, not just the men. Mr. Manolo, a kagawad, also said that it is great having both of the ladies in the council because they are more outgoing than the men and more energetic than them. They contribute a lot of ideas, A LOT of ideas. Some were not implemented but many were, like for example the hair science activity, they were the ones who conceptualized that. They thought that hair science is not just for women but also for men. That's just an example of it and they have been looking forward to many more activities. Mr. De San Andres also stated that one of the female officials, Mrs. Anafe Piedad, was one of the most workaholic person in the commitee but sadly she passed away last December. But, still, they said that they were sad losing one of their comrades but happy because they get to know her and work with her and it makes them smile just thinking about it. The barangay is also hiring people with disabilities (PWDs). "It does not matter if you are a person with disabilities, we are only looking for one ability here, is the ability to help the barangay and help the people in the community. If you are able to do that then there is no reason not to hire you. We are an open barangay." stated Mr. De San Andres.</p>
